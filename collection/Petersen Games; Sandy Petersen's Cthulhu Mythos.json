It has certainly been a successful partnership. In return for protection, shelter, and food, cats keep down the population of rodents and other pest animals in humanoid areas, which helps ward off both disease and famine. In addition, cats provide affection, companionship, elegance, and beauty to their humanoid families\u2014at least on their own terms. And during their languorous periods of rest, watched over by a humanoid family that has learned not to interrupt them, cats can walk the Dreamlands with enhanced mental acuity and reason.",

When this happens, it becomes what is known as a Dreamlands cat, and becomes a suitable choice for a player character. Any cat may make this decision, and it may spend just a few days as a Dreamlands cat, or remain that way for the rest of its life.

Sometimes, they may lurk behind a backyard fence, or a cat might find them in an abandoned badger burrow, or else up a spooky old tree. Only cats know for sure, for they seem drawn to these portals only they can see. Humanoids can only tell the cat has left physically when, for instance, the cat runs into the attic and doesn't return for a day or so. Most assume this means the cat is merely hiding somewhere they cannot find it.",

A cat cannot simply escape to the Dreamlands when it is, for example, caught in a trap or imprisoned, unless the Gates happen to manifest at the same location.

This snout isn't large enough to significantly distort or hamper the ghoul's ability to speak or express itself, although ghouls do tend to have a guttural, raspy tone to their voices. A ghoul's ears are large and pointed, and its hair is generally short and mangy with thick bristly patches on the back, shoulders, and forearms.

Almost never falling ill encourages such filthy habits, but this nonchalance toward propriety and presentation stems in part from the amusement many ghouls derive from making humanoids feel uncomfortable and nauseated.",

Scholars have yet to discern a scientific explanation for this ability, relegating such powers to the realm of the supernatural. While they delight in this ability to digest memories, ghouls themselves have neither an explanation nor a desire to learn more about how or why it functions, and many adhere to the strange superstition that knowing the reason for this would disrupt the mechanism itself.

As such, family is a complex subject for ghouls: many of them have been forced to abandon their own when their transformation into a ghoul resulted in a shameful, often violent flight from home. Many nascent ghouls live the first several years of their lives after becoming a ghoul in self-imposed solitude and may in fact have no idea others of their kind even exist. Ghoul societies are quick to embrace new brothers or sisters, because almost every ghoul vividly remembers the loneliness, anxiety, and fear of this transitionary period.",
								"While most ghouls eventually learn to appreciate these foster siblings as true kin, many never recover from the shock of losing the families that raised them. Such ghouls, who live much longer than most mortal races, often return to their homes decades later to watch or stalk previous relations. Such returns only occasionally result in violence: more commonly, ghouls demonstrate a dark kind of patience in achieving their goals while avoiding confrontation. For instance, if a ghoul learns that a family member has passed away, grave robbery is often quick to follow. Feeding on the decayed flesh of a parent, sibling, or child can bring a ghoul a grisly form of closure, as they experience shadows and fragments of their previous life by digesting the memories of their prior relations. Ghouls who seek this closure often keep a memento of the event as a keepsake, such as a skull or less frequently some sort of heirloom, such as a weapon, piece of jewelry, or other item.",
								"Ghouls can have children of their own, but when a new ghoul is birthed, the baby appears as a normal child of a humanoid race linked to the ghoul's own bloodline. Ghoul parents often can't resist the urge to seek out a family to raise their child in the hope of giving their baby a chance at something approaching a normal life. Ghouls leave children as orphans or foundlings on temple stoops or in areas where they suspect and hope that an unexpected baby will be cared for. In other cases, desperate or callous ghouls will take more sinister measures. Stealing into a village or township under cover of deep night, the ghoul parents seek out a child in the village who looks similar to their own, then swap the children in the hope that the changeling will be raised in comfort and luxury. The kidnapped child is then raised as a ghoul.",
								"In an ironic twist of fate, both children in these sorts of \"switched-at-birth\" situations develop into nascent ghouls: the changeling itself as a result of her ghoulish bloodline, and the abductee as a result of growing up knowing nothing more than using tombstones as platters and graveyards under moonlight as playgrounds.

Ghouls are protective of their children\u2014particularly those who look more ghoul-like\u2014and shelter them in the deepest corners of their graveyard warrens. As a result, they are only rarely encountered by non-ghouls, giving rise to the false suppositions that ghoul children do not exist, and that ghouls only come to be when they magically transform victims into their own kind.",
								"Becoming a Mythos ghoul through magic is rare. Certainly, curses and magical infections can cause ghouls to manifest as well, but ghouls cannot \"infect\" their victims like a disease or lycanthrope. Most who become cursed or otherwise transformed into ghouls meet their fate not through interaction with ghouls, but through powerful magic or curses in old tombs, from reading forbidden texts, or by taking part in blasphemous rituals. In fact, those who pursue it often find themselves accidentally turning into undead ghouls. Regardless, Mythos ghouls do not make a habit of creating more of their own kind through magical means.",
								"Graveyards remember when they have played host to ghouls, and becoming a ghoul is as much a matter of behavior and atmosphere as it is one of magic or genetics. People who engage in ghoulish activity, be it feeding on decayed flesh or living in graveyards, put themselves at risk of becoming ghouls. This risk increases if such behaviors are undertaken in the company of other ghouls or if they're pursued in regions where ghouls once cavorted and dined, even if no ghouls have been active in an area for decades or even centuries. A child, abducted by ghouls and raised among their kind, can transform into a ghoul, despite potentially having no predilection toward a ghoulish nature or heritage from a ghoul. Curiously, those who deliberately seek the transformation into a ghoul and engage in such activities to foster such a change often find their goal elusive. The change seems to seek those who don't expect it but avoids those who pursue it.",
								"Typically, a humanoid that undergoes the transformation into a ghoul does not make the change swiftly. Instead, the victim spends a significant amount of time, often many years, as something known as a \"nascent ghoul.\" Once a creature makes the transition to full ghoul, either after enduring the change via nascent ghouldom or simply by growing to adulthood as a ghoul child, the ghoul can live for centuries. A ghoul reaches middle age at 100 years, old age at 300 years, and venerable age at 500 years. Curiously, ghouls do not actually die of old age, but they do grow increasingly feeble {@dice 1d100} years after reaching venerable age. After this time passes, a ghoul loses the ability to fend for itself or even move, and will eventually die of starvation if not fed. Many ghouls, rather than endure an endless existence helplessly dependent on family, offer themselves to the banquet table. This funeral feast is not a matter of shame or despair in ghoul society, but one of triumph, for in feeding upon the elder, their memories, knowledge, and personality can live on in those who partake."

This form of ancestor worship typically manifests in one or two ways: a ghoul may look back upon their parents and their parents' parents for advice, mining their accomplishments for inspiration, or a ghoul might look back upon their own life, particularly in the case of a changeling ghoul who has finally undergone full transformation. To these ghouls, lost family members, whether living or dead, become as ancestors to venerate: their existence is like something out of a past life. Worship of these childhood memories is all some ghouls have to keep their minds from fully toppling into madness and they may even continue to wear familiar clothing (often robbed from graves) and carry gear and weapons in an attempt to cling to their previous lives. Ghouls stuck in the past in this way often become objects of pity among their brethren, who typically leave them to wallow in their own memories as long as they do no harm. Such ghouls may try to reestablish contact with lost family, and even if this does not result in tragedy, such an event can reveal the presence of a ghoul colony to humanity, which can cause problems (see {@b Relations}).

								"Without a true culture to call their own, ghouls seem perfectly content to immerse themselves in the cultures of those they dine upon. As a result, most ghoul societies trail somewhat behind the times, with their aesthetics often seeming very old-fashioned compared to the modern-day cultures under whose graveyards they hide. By scavenging what these societies throw away, ghouls create a parasitic form of culture that suits them well and keeps them sated and happy. They treat ancient tools and discarded objects with reverence and respect and can typically eke out several more uses of objects other cultures have discarded as ruined.",
								"Regardless of the society whose culture they've appropriated, ghouls usually form into relatively small groups known as clans for a very practical purpose. A ghoul clan is limited in size by the pool of available dead, and if the clan depletes a graveyard or feed so quickly that their host society notices the depredations visited upon their deceased, the ghouls may find themselves forced out of their homes or pushed into violent confrontations.",
								"The typical ghoul clan prefers to lair in extensive warrens dug by tool and claw into the earth below a graveyard, but clans have been known to settle in abandoned necropolises or ruined cities. Anywhere there's a large or steady source of meat to feed upon can serve a ghoul as a home\u2014specifically dead meat, as they do not hunt living creatures for food save for in times of famine. They prefer flesh that is properly aged, at least by a few days and, if possible, for much longer. Mummified flesh is considered a delicacy to a ghoul. When a ghoul encounters a particularly delicious corpse (often the remains of a philosopher, wizard, alchemist, poet, or other great thinker who died years ago), they keep the remains handy in storage. Ghouls maintain entire \"cellars\" of corpses to feed upon, with walls lined with open coffins displaying their grisly contents in a macabre parody of human wine cellars. Here, they keep their favorite bodies in storage, nibbling only now and then on these finely aged bones and preserved bits of flesh when the urge to celebrate strikes.",
								"Undead often dwell in and around locales that ghouls favor, and for their part, ghouls do not abhor undead themselves. Indeed, most ghouls find the taste of undead flesh to be delicious, and they have difficulty explaining how necromancy flavors flesh to those who lack their interests. At times, lingering death magic has an almost narcotic impact on those who overindulge, which some ghouls particularly enjoy\u2014a bit like drinking to excess but to far more potent effect. It's not unusual to encounter ghoul societies that keep zombies as guardians and livestock simultaneously."

When ghouls and humanoids meet, however, the result is almost always violent. Most humanoids are quick to interpret the discovery of bestial-looking parodies of their own shape dwelling in their graveyards and eating their dead as unsettling at best, or downright blasphemous at worst. Once humanoids know of the clan's presence, ghouls can expect continuous harassment.",
								"The typical ghoul is more than a match for an average humanoid, and even though such humanoids are usually the ones to start confrontations when ghouls are discovered, ghouls are usually the ones to escalate or finish the fight. Though the results vary, conflict with a group of humanoids almost never ends well for a ghoul clan in the long run. They might be wiped out, destroyed by superior weapons or numbers, or otherwise forced to move on to find a new feeding ground.",
								"While humanoid settlements generally have difficulty establishing peaceful relations with ghouls, the same is not the case for individuals. Often, an artist, necromancer, or eccentric who learns of the presence of ghouls in a local graveyard will seek to establish peaceful contact with the ghouls. For their part, ghouls value such contacts, for they give the clan insight into the workings of the society they feed upon, and such a contact can also help cover up their presence or warn them when their feeding becomes noticeable. In return, ghoul clans can offer value to their allies by revealing secrets lost to the ages or insights about history, supplying aid in dealing with undead, or serving as guides into underground regions.",
								"Some humanoids actively seek out becoming a ghoul, which generally makes ghouls nervous. Rarely will a ghoul encourage a humanoid to become a ghoul, much less help them transform. Most ghouls rankle at the idea of \"gifting\" a humanoid with their abilities, and some feel ashamed at inflicting what they feel is a curse. There's also a practical reason: any humanoid ally is a potential meal, and once a ghoul, an ex-humanoid is less likely to grace a banquet table\u2014at least for a long, long time.",
								"When it comes to sentient undead, although Mythos ghouls often share common interests and often tastes, there is rarely peaceful cooperation between the two groups. While ghouls enjoy the flavor of intelligent undead more than mindless ones, these undead typically understand that ghouls make poor allies. Curiously, while undead ghouls seem eager to feed upon their living counterparts, Mythos ghouls tend to find the flesh of undead ghouls to be unpleasant, describing it as \"overripe\" or \"rancid\" in flavor."

Since adventurers often have a much higher tolerance for strangeness, a ghoul is more likely to find acceptance in an adventuring party, which can offer important protection and support.

These last, perhaps above all else, inspire endless terror in the imagination of many, and the gnorri fulfill their dread promise.",

Their strange-colored skin, mutable number of arms, and tentacle-like lower bodies seem designed by a malevolence bent on evoking many of humanity's deepest fears. The gnorri lurk in the lightless depths of unplumbed ocean trenches and shadowed reefs, mysterious and alien to those who breathe air and abide upon the land.",

While there are those among the gnorri who harbor sadism and cruelty in their hearts, this is no different than any sentient race; on the whole the gnorri are more interested in trading than warring with land dwellers. Indeed, in certain ports, the initial fear and suspicion of the gnorri has given way to respect and a kind of cooperation.

To the gnorri, it is enough to believe that they have always existed, and thus they are comforted in the knowledge that they will always exist. Certainly, their coral cities and grottos often have the appearance of great age, indicating that their presence in the sea has lasted much longer than humanity's presence on land.",

Indeed, the first tribes of coastal-dwelling societies understood and feared the ocean, and in their troubled dreams imagined ways of surviving in the depths. Over the course of eons, these primitive humanoids learned to build boats and sail. In so doing, they lost their waking fear of the sea, and their awed aquatic dreams acquired lives as the gnorri. Or at least so the texts suggest.",

								"Gnorri appear vaguely humanoid from the torso up, yet the more one learns about how gnorri bodies work, the more their humanoid appearance seems like a coincidence. Gnorri have a chiseled body like that of a humanoid above the waist and a tentacular lower trunk. Some gnorri even have suction cups along their tails, but this is uncommon. Above water, gnorri exude a thin layer of glistening slime that keeps them looking freshly emerged from the sea. Gnorri's fingers are webbed to aid in swimming but they can absorb this webbing partially into their flesh when they wish to wear rings or gloves.",
								"What appears to be hair on a gnorri's head is actually a forest of thin tendrils more akin to the undercarriage of a jellyfish than anything else. All gnorri possess this fringe of tendrils along the chin and sides of the face, giving them their distinctive \"bearded\" look. These tendrils function like gills, converting water to air for their lungs. When the gnorri head is fully dry, such as after a long period in a dry environment, its hair-like tendrils fall off along with any fins they may have. A gnorri missing their \"beard\" and \"hair\" can drown in water. Fortunately for such gnorri, these tendrils swiftly regrow when the face or body is exposed to water, re-emerging over the course of {@dice 2d4} minutes. If a gnorri is drowning, they can retreat above the waves to breathe air.",
								"One of the most unusual features of gnorri physiology is the eerie mutability of their flesh and bones. While the basic gnorri shape remains solid and fixed, upon close examination, one can watch their scales slither and slide slowly over their body or the ridges and wrinkles of their tentacles shift and change. This fleshy fluidity is even greater inside, with entire organs \"swimming\" within their bodies, severing and re-attaching connections seemingly at random. At one moment, the heart may be situated within the chest, but in another it may descend into the belly to be embraced by the entrails while the liver slithers up into the chest to nuzzle against the air bladder or lung.",
								"This trait not only allows gnorri to withstand sudden trauma to their bodies, but more amazingly, it allows them to grow or retract limbs. By concentrating, gnorri can extrude additional arms or withdraw them back into their bodies by reallocating flesh, muscle, and bone. The process takes ten minutes or so and is so exhausting gnorri cannot change the number of their arms more than once per day. Technically, gnorri could have one or no arms, but they gain no significant advantage from such a change. Gnorri cannot extrude more than four arms at once and rarely even create that many unless they wish to wield multiple weapons. This process does not change a gnorri's mass; while gnorri have three or four arms, their bodies are weakened from the redistribution.",
								"Most gnorri dwell within the relatively shallow reaches of the ocean, near the coastlines at depths of a few hundred feet. In fact, strange physiologies afford them great flexibility in choosing a home. Gnorri who dwell in deeper waters often adapt to a darker and more dangerous environment, taking on stranger shapes or becoming bioluminescent, larger, or more powerful. Those who dwell in the depths are generally more defensive and less interested in mixing with surface dwellers, and the relative scarcity of food results in a corresponding relaxation of taboos against such acts as feeding on sentient races or, in the most extreme cases, cannibalism.",
								"Gnorri have three sexes: female, male, and builder. The females produce eggs, males fertilize them, and builders are responsible for the creation of the grottos that gnorri live in. None of these is held at any greater or lesser esteem than the others, for Gnorri judge individuals strictly by their merits."

While gnorri value companionship and engage in something akin to sexual relationships with favored partners, such actions are not linked to the act of perpetuating the species (see below for details). In any event, as a result of their unusual \"childhoods,\" no gnorri knows or much cares about the identity of its parents or how many siblings it might have, and a gnorri rarely desires to know its children. Gnorri are capable of forming friendships, and these can last for entire lifetimes in some cases, but the concept of familial attachment is a curiosity at best to the gnorri."

								"Once or twice a month, a female gnorri expels a mass of eggs from her body, abandoning them to drift on the currents. These eggs can drift for days or even weeks before losing viability. When in the presence of gnorri eggs, a male gnorri exudes sperm in an almost unconscious reaction much like sweating. Once fertilized, gnorri eggs hatch within 24 hours into microscopic, plankton-like creatures that drift and churn among others in their myriad numbers.",
								"Since it is traditional among gnorri to exude their eggs in certain designated areas, and numerous gnorri use the same areas to store their eggs, there's really no way to keep track of how many hundreds or thousands of children might arise each generation or to identify the parents. Most newborn gnorri are consumed by predators, but the sheer volume of young ensures enough survive the two to four months it takes to grow to adulthood. During this time, the gnorri shed their outer skin multiple times to make way for their rapidly expanding bodies.",
								"Upon reaching maturity, a gnorri plankton achieves the size and rough shape of something akin to a human-sized eel. It sheds its skin one final time and emerges a gnorri, growing to full size after another three or so years spent in constant hunger. Since gnorri are fully capable of laying and fertilizing eggs immediately upon emerging from this eel-like shape, they can be biologically considered mature adults, but in most cases they wait until they are full grown to seek roles in gnorri society.",
								"Once a gnorri reaches its full size, its metabolism slows dramatically. Whereas it takes only a few years for a gnorri to go from freshly-hatched plankton to full-sized member of its race, an adult gnorri can live for centuries unless killed through violence, misadventure, or illness. A gnorri becomes middle aged at 150 years, old at 250 years, and venerable at 500 years. Once venerable age is reached, a gnorri's body swiftly begins to degrade, and the fluidity of its flesh and bones rapidly diminishes. At this age, a gnorri loses their ability to adjust the number of their arms and the protective features of their amorphous entrails. They live every moment of their life in increasing pain, leading most venerable gnorri to take their own lives or to seek death via a tradition called the Great Walk. For a gnorri that is not killed prior to the natural expiration of life, death comes painfully as a rigor mortis-like condition sets in within months, resulting first in general paralysis, followed shortly thereafter by heart failure and death."

As gnorri age, they seek greater accomplishments, and as a result, leaders among the gnorri tend to be older. In the sad case of those gnorri whose age outstrips their accomplishments, exile may be a preferable fate to constant ridicule or pity from the mouths of their younger, more accomplished fellows.",
								"Gnorri do not build complex cities, but settlements can grow quite large in size. They tend to live in tune with their environments, using nearby materials for construction, particularly coral. Gnorri coral shapers are masters at guiding the growth of coral through diverse methods, ranging from physical carving to alchemical enhancement. Builders usually favor naturally-occurring caverns or rifts along the cave floor in sheltering a gnorri settlement, but in most cases, they wed such natural features to crafted palaces. Bones are also a valued building material for weapons and buildings alike. When a great sea beast dies, gnorri are quick to strip the body of its flesh and harvest the bones to serve once more as a skeleton, this time as the superstructure for an undersea building.",
								"While gnorri are omnivorous, they generally prefer lives as vegetarians, for their teeth are not sharp and have difficulty chewing through flesh. This is, of course, a strange disconnect for very young gnorri, who in their plankton stage are dedicated carnivores who feed only on flesh. Gnorri keep large farms of kelp and other seaweeds, but also raise slow-moving slug-like creatures or pens of jellyfish as livestock. These creatures also provide key resources for gnorri alchemists (see {@b Culture} below)."

They have a \"does it matter\" perspective on what happens after life ends. Nor do they believe in any sort of apocalypse: nature has always existed and will always exist and so it is with the gnorri.",

An example of this is how they use their innate magical ability to turn rock into mud to make grottos. As a society, gnorri don't build places of worship within their communities. They see no need to.",

While recognized as druids by folk who dwell on the land, gnorri do not view themselves as part of a religion or sect. Gnorri feel no great connection or comradeship with druids of the land, and will not hold them to any particular religious expectations or give them any special treatment.",
								"Gnorri druids do gather in groups, not to worship but to learn from one another. They recognize that some teachings can lead to great power. To protect this power and to trade learning with land druids, gnorri druids have adopted the secret Druidic language\u2014a special dialect seen in the growth of coral and heard in the flow of the wave\u2014though they rarely use the language amongst themselves.",
								"Other gnorri servants of divine powers are relatively rare and tend to view their relationship with the divine in a transactional light. Gnorri paladins focused on ideals and virtues often find collaboration with deities useful, but rarely would they call their relationship one of worship. Very rarely will a gnorri become a cleric, as most of their kind cannot comprehend the attraction of worshiping a god and may see such a faith as a sign of madness. While not outcasts, clerics and other gnorri that follow a god or pantheon operate outside the grottos that house gnorri communities, as there is literally no place within the cities of the gnorri for them to gather and worship. This holds true regardless of whether the cleric and followers worship a virtuous god or one of the Great Old Ones, who have been known to attract gnorri who so radically depart from the conventions of their people."

Without family concerns and with merit in society determined by personal accomplishment, each gnorri swiftly settles into a chosen specialty without the expectations and pressures of raising more gnorri. This allows an individual gnorri to strive their best to ensure greater personal prestige while simultaneously bolstering the society as a whole. Although the gnorri aren't particularly interested in the origin of their species, they value other aspects of their history and culture, along with science. They are far from a primitive society, but their underwater environs have resulted in their written language following a different path from those of surface dwellers. Traditional gnorri writings are carved on stone surfaces or tablets using metal tools scavenged or traded from surface folk or magical methods of inscription. As their culture has grown, other, less cumbersome and less expensive methods of writing have developed.",

This method of kelp writing has an advantage over paper and ink in that it remains viable both above and below water.",
								"Traditional gnorri building methods utilize magic and integrate nature and terrain. A gnorri group looking to establish a town is more likely to pick as the site of their new home a craggy section of underwater rifts and caverns, rather than an open expanse of lush seaweed plains. This gives the gnorri additional defenses against sea monsters and other dangerous denizens of the deep. Without the ready ability to manufacture metal, glass, and pottery under water, gnorri who desire these items must rely on trade with the surface.",
								"Fortunately for the gnorri, two of their cultural specialties are very much in demand from surface dwellers: alchemy and surgery. Rather than focusing on potions and fluids, which are difficult to contain and manage in an aquatic environment, gnorri alchemists focus on thicker, more solid media, such as oozes, plant life, and small animals. A gnorri alchemist uses a collection of venomous crustaceans, a wide array of aquatic plants, and flesh harvested from a wide range of invertebrate creatures for a diverse and versatile take on alchemy. Eating a tiny preserved anemone might function as a healing potion, for instance, or else deliver a deadly dose of jellyfish venom hidden inside. This work has made gnorri particularly adept in the crafting of poisons, as much of their work involves using and repurposing venoms extracted from their living tools.",
								"The gnorri's deep knowledge of biology aids them in larger healing projects involving more complex organisms as well, and gnorri surgeons are among the most gifted under and above the waves alike. While almost all gnorri display a talent for minor applications of first aid and other forms of healing, some among their number have taken this science even further, with the ability to graft flesh and transform subjects using a wide variety of methods. While it's easier for them to perform these flesh-altering procedures on fellow gnorri, those who specialize in operating on surface dwellers find their talents in high demand. Gnorri surgeons can earn their communities a huge haul of glass and metal tools by performing a single operation to graft gills onto a human pearl diver or a seaside merchant, for example."

Beyond that, things start to break down, as communities grow more different the farther apart they lie.

They prefer to maintain a respectful distance, neither community relying on the other.",

Scavenging for items from shipwrecks is a long tradition, but unless gnorri specifically target trade ships and sink them for goods, it's impossible to depend on sunken salvage as a constant resource. Since the gnorri are, as a whole, loath to prey upon the ships that sail above, they have turned to more peaceful options, such as trade, which requires setting aside long-standing superstitions and fears about the surface world.",
								"Trade presents significant hurdles for the gnorri, not the least of which is their natural difficulty interacting with air-breathing creatures. Most trade groups employ at least one diplomat to serve as a translator, as well as an ambassador to help handle confusing differences in culture, but this goes only so far. For example, for most gnorri, telling one humanoid apart from another is a constant struggle. A group of gnorri whose first contact with air-breathing creatures happens to be with centaurs might assume all air breathers have four legs, or they might view humans and horses as \"half-centaurs,\" perhaps separated from their other half by a cataclysmic magical curse or wound.",
								"The concept of legs is endlessly fascinating to the gnorri and somewhat disturbing. It is as strange and unsettling for a gnorri to see a humanoid walk by putting one foot in front of the other as it might be for a human to watch a gnorri's tail slither out in front of their upper body like a snake. Gnorri are baffled and at times disgusted by the rhythmic \"sawing\" of legs moving back and forth, bending only at the knee and ankle but otherwise rigid.

						"Menacing inhabitants of the deep woods, zoogs are widely dreaded and sometimes mocked from a safe distance. Unlike many feared races, the superstitions and legends about zoogs are well-founded\u2014they are not \"misunderstood,\" but are just as dangerous and unsettling as the tales tell. Small rodent-like humanoids, zoogs lurk in shadowed forests and burrows, waiting for unwitting prey. Terrifying puppet masters, the zoogs flutter threats and taunts as they lure victims ever closer to their doom.",
						"At the same time, much of a zoog's capacity to evoke terror is situational and atmospheric. Beneath the benighted treetops, their small size and natural grace let them hide almost anywhere and strike from any angle. Caught in the open or confronted outside their natural environment, they seem more like oversized rodents that are almost laughable. For this reason, zoogs stay out of sight, relying upon misdirection and confusion before they strike. Surrounded by an unknown number of allies in the woods, chittering from all directions and echoing in the darkness, zoogs can be truly terrifying.",
						"Most zoogs are content to dwell in their forest homelands, but they are curious beings and are known to roam far abroad. Zoogs often accompany members of other races, hoping for protection. Occasionally, they make a major foray into the outside world or decide to colonize another wood. Anyone who knows of zoogs and their ways would do well to treat news of harassment in the forest and unexplained disappearances as a cause for alarm.",

Neither do they share oral histories among their own people, as they have no interest in dwelling on what has gone before. For this reason, the \"history\" of these unsettling people is often whatever the zoogs decide to tell a human they have chosen to trick or befriend.",
								"The zoogs make a major exception when it comes to genealogy. They determine social class based upon generation-spanning family connections, and so keep meticulous track of family trees for chosen zoogs and their chosen ancestors. How exactly they track this information is a secret unknown to other races, since they tell few tales and keep records even more rarely.",
								"Masters of their environs, zoogs tend to make their homes in dark and haunted forests. Far worse creatures than zoogs often dwell therein, and the zoogs learn caution near a lich's fortress or a troll den. Larger and more powerful beings often ignore the small and comparatively weak zoogs, who can then take advantage of their proximity.",
								"Zoogs have a history of making direct pacts with monstrous creatures for mutual benefit, the way a crocodile might allow small birds to pick its teeth clean. For example, in a forest containing a dragon, the zoogs are adept at luring raiding parties of adventurers into the dragon's lair. Generally amoral and opportunistic, zoogs have few objections to working with evil monsters, but they also recognize the danger such creatures pose. In some cases, if a particularly dangerous creature moves in, the zoogs may seek the assistance of a party of adventurers to rid their forest of the risk. This must be done before the zoogs forge a treaty with the monster, however, as zoogs always keep their word."

All four of their limbs terminate in hand-like paws capable of fine work or wielding weapons. In addition, they have long, bare, prehensile tails that give them even more options for manipulation. Their mouths have needle-like teeth, and their faces are adorned with small prehensile tentacles, which they primarily use to manipulate food but can also use to grasp small objects or help with delicate tinkering. They have round, bulging eyes and large ears that grant senses as keen as those of a cat, if not keener.",
								"Though zoogs are naturally nocturnal, bright light does not harm or hamper them. They can swim when they must and can climb as well as any monkey. While they can use tools and often keep useful objects in their burrows, zoogs cannot easily carry more than two such items around with them at a time (one in each pouch).",

They speak their own tongue, which is only taught to outsiders who have signed a treaty with the forest. All zoogs, regardless of their forest, speak the same language, which is instinctive rather than learned. Hence, even a zoog raised by humans will grow up able to communicate with its own kind perfectly naturally, even if it has never interacted with another zoog.",
								"Zoogs are technically omnivorous, but they function best on meat. While they are able to eat some fruits and vegetables (usually raw), prolonged reliance on plant matter tends to make them listless and sick. Fresh meat is always a treat, preferably eaten raw.

								"Zoogs give birth to 6 to 12 pouchlings after a gestation period of only 10 to 15 days. The blind, nearly-embryonic young are only about an inch long, perfectly sized for the mother to pick them up and put them into her pouches. She puts the four best-looking or most interesting young into her favored pouch, and these become her \"chosen.\" This is often but not always the right-hand pouch; she-zoogs are \"left-pouched\" or \"right-pouched\", just as humans are \"right-handed\" or \"left-handed.\" All the other young are placed into her less-preferred pouch, thus becoming \"off-pouch.\" Each pouch normally has four internal nipples, so if five or more babies are off-pouch, only four survive\u2014typically the strongest or fastest. The others starve within a day or two, and the mother cleans dead offspring out of the pouch and usually eats them.",
								"The pouchlings stay attached to the mother's nipples and don't leave the pouch for 2 to 3 months. When they emerge, fully-furred and capable of life on their own, they are now called \"zooglets.\" They usually stay in or near the parental home until maturity, a process which takes 2 to 3 years. At this point, parents and young go their separate ways.",
								"Zoogs can live for a long time\u2014much longer than most small mammals\u2014but rarely even half as long as humans. Zoogs older than 30 to 40 years are forced to extend their longevity through magical potions, forest herbs, or spells. More than a few learned zoogs have mastered these age-defeating techniques, and zoogs over 300 years of age are found in the older forests of the Dreamlands.",
								"Zoogs breed more quickly than almost any other sentient race. A typical zoog is ready to mate within a year after leaving home (so, from 3 to 5 years of age). It then has up to eight viable progeny, which it raises to maturity. When those zoogs leave home, the zoog is ready to mate again. This means that a typical zoog first mates around the age of 4, and then has almost exactly eight surviving offspring about every four years following this. This means that twenty pairs of breeding zoogs (a typical colonization group) can increase to 50,000 adult zoogs in only two decades with an abundant and vast enough forest to sustain them."

								"Each individual zoog forest is its own independent nation, established on the backs of iron-clad treaties with surrounding societies. Zoogs never go to war with other zoogs; indeed, they are bemused that other sentient races fight amongst themselves. Not engaging in such strife does not preclude them from taking advantage of it, however, and zoogs happily seize the opportunity to exploit a conflict for their own gain.",
								"Zoog society and social importance are closely tied to their biology. Zoogs raised in their mother's preferred pouch are the chosen, promoted and trusted as the upper tier of zoog society, while those raised in the inferior pouch are the off-pouch and are considered lower class. As a matter of biological fact, there are almost never more off-pouch than chosen and vice versa in a given zoog forest, notwithstanding death and infant mortality. The chosen vs. off-pouch hierarchy is the most fundamental differentiation in zoog society, and it forms the basis of their system of nobility.",
								"Though they belong to a lower social class and never become leaders, off-pouch zoogs are still full members of zoog society. They may provide valuable labor and services, and they are neither mistreated nor enslaved by other zoogs. Zoogs are puzzled when other races take offense to their system: after all, humans, elves, and dwarves have hereditary systems of government as well, often incorporating serfs, a middle-class, and nobility. The zoog system is superior, they feel, because the chosen zoogs are hand-selected by the mother for superiority. After all, in many humanoid societies, nobility is inherited regardless of merit or ability.",
								"Zoogs, unlike many other humanoids, do not segregate by social class when mating. When two chosen zoogs mate, however, their own chosen young are termed second-generation, and are considered upper-class. When two second-generation chosen zoogs mate, their chosen offspring are third generation. This process continues up to the eighth generation, and of course can go beyond, but the zoogs don't often keep track past that point. Even eighth-generation chosen zoogs are vanishingly rare.",
								"If a higher-generation zoog mates with a lower-generation noble, the offspring are considered to be the same as if the lower-generation zoog had mated with its own kind. Thus, if a fifth and a second generation zoog mate, the chosen babies are considered third generation. It some-times seems odd to humans that zoogs make no attempt to mate higher generation zoog together, but the zoogs are happy with their system, and it seems to work for them.",
								"However, an off-pouch zoog born even to a sixth-gen-eration zoog is still just off-pouch. It has no counted generation and no special privileges, though it may enjoy advantages based on family ties. For example, a high-rank-ing zoog noble often has family guards and aides chosen from among off-pouch siblings.",
								"Second-generation zoogs are considered the upper-ranks of society but are not necessarily leaders or nobles. Each successive generation is more highly ranked. Third generation and higher zoogs are the zoog nobility, and these individuals are not only rare but valued by zoog society for their superiority and leadership qualities.",
								"Each zoog forest is run by a council of nobles, who consult one another to make all decisions. Zoogs don't have monarchs or any sort of head zoog. Instead, the various nobles gather together when major decisions need to be made and debate. In their councils, the higher-generation nobles speak with greater weight, but all voices are considered. Due to the fact of group births, there are rarely fewer than four zoog siblings of the highest generation. Zoogs are not stupid, and the nobles are perfectly willing to take advice and suggestions from less-prestigious zoogs\u2014even off-pouch zoogs may be called to participate in councils. For instance, if a well-traveled off-pouch zoog has key insights into the surrounding world, that zoog might be called upon to speak to a council that is dealing with an impending conflict. A single noble may lead a group of zoogs in some major task\u2014for example, constructing a large trap designed to capture a large animal\u2014and rely upon the experience of a less-prestigious zoog who has some expertise in that field.",
								"Zoogs also have an equivalent to human guilds, in which all like-minded zoogs within a forest share wisdom or work on large projects. Typical zoog guilds include trap-makers, magical researchers, alchemists (a generic term for all tinkerers), loremasters, and animal tamers. Unlike human guilds, these are traditionally led and ruled by one or more noble zoogs and advised by the rest. The nobles are not necessarily the most experienced workers in the trade, but they do receive training and are expected to be willing to listen to other, more skilled zoogs, regardless of rank. Young nobles are assigned as apprentices to the various guilds so that they can learn the trade and be ready to take positions of leadership.",

										"The natural, most comfortable habitats for zoogs are dark, deep woods. Often, when zoogs wish to colonize a new region, they must travel through the outside world, which is a dangerous proposition. They may try to avoid trouble by moving only at night, or else bargain with fey to gain access to their strange magic or mysterious portals. Occasionally, zoogs make a treaty with groups whose lands they must travel through, offering to gift their hosts with magic or unusual forest herbs in exchange for protection.",
										"Protection deals can involve adventurers, who may be tasked by their kingdom or their friends to travel with the zoog host and keep them safe from enemies and ambushes. Herding along a large mob of small, ferocious zoogs while wolves, trolls, or other natural foes try to pick off some of the troop could be a challenging but rewarding trek. Hazards might include bandits hoping to kidnap a zoog noble or a family, bitter about past zoog predations, lusting for vengeance."

Hence, a typical zoog war lasts only a day or two and ends in a complete victory for one side or the other: either the zoog ambush works or it doesn't.",
										"Zoogs are highly protective of their high-ranking nobles because they take so many generations to produce. Their wars are almost always triggered by the death (accidental or otherwise) of a noble zoog or zooglet.",

										"One of the best-known features of zoog law is their universal recognition of treaties. A given treaty is only made with one entity or organization at a time. A treaty may be agreed between the forest and a nation, race, village, or even just a single person. If two villages each want a treaty with the zoogs, they must negotiate separately. While treaties can cover a wide number of topics, typically the arrangement is for the zoogs to permit free passage through their forest in exchange for some consideration from the other party.",
										"Treaties are not written down (at least, not by the zoogs), since every zoog in the forest is required to memorize every treaty to which the forest agrees. Still, an old treaty may be unknown to younger zoogs, and over time, treaties can \"wear off.\" This can happen in only one to three decades, considering the condensed breeding cycle of zoogs.",
										"When a treaty is being considered, the zoog council of nobles debates it. If they reach a favorable decision, the other party is brought into the zoog colony, and all the zoogs convene to identify and learn to recognize that individual or group. For example, when the zoogs of Blackwood made the Treaty of Eternal Friendship with the gnomes of Willendilly, the gnomes sent several dozen gnomes, of all ages and walks of life, to Blackwood so the zoogs could memorize their appearance and dress, and thus refrain from preying upon residents of that land. This treaty was eventually broken unwittingly by the zoogs when they captured and devoured three gnomes from Willendilly that had traveled and picked up styles of dress from elsewhere, unaware that these gnomes were residents of Willendilly.",
										"Treaties can be predatory in nature. For example, when the cats of Ulthar attacked and defeated the zoogs of the Enchanted Woods, they took a number of noble zoog youths as hostages. Those zoogs agreed never again to molest or eat a cat, and in turn, the cats agreed to keep their hostages alive. Unfortunately for the zoogs, this treaty was not to their advantage, for it did not stipulate when the hostages would be released\u2014if ever\u2014but such is reality. Naturally, if the tables were turned, the zoogs would have enforced a treaty to their own ends. They consider exploitation of loopholes to be extremely fair.",
										"Zoogs rarely break treaties on purpose, but they are known to abuse them to an extreme. In one case, the zoogs of the Screaming Woods had a treaty with a particular family. The oldest son of this family took a band of his friends into the deepest part of the forest, expecting that the zoogs would honor the family treaty, and thus grant them safe passage. The zoogs trapped them all, cut up the friends' bodies, and served them at a great feast. The son alone was spared, but they forced him to partake in the feast. When they sent him home, he was physically uninjured, but stark raving mad. Since they had not killed him, the zoogs considered that they had fulfilled their obligations to the letter.",
										"While a given treaty only applies to a particular zoog forest, if someone who participates in such a treaty can demonstrate this to another zoog forest, it often eases their path toward acceptance and safety. Once a village or person signs a treaty with one zoog community, other zoogs often fall into line quickly and easily.",

They are always, at their core, pragmatists in any kind of religious devotion, though they are able to parrot belief in order to comfort or fool humans or other races. Zoog druids draw strength and power from the forests as a practical measure, rather than out of devotion to nature as an entity.",
								"Zoog clerics exist, largely out of a desire to placate a more powerful entity. When a zoog forest hosts a perilous and powerful spiritual creature, the zoogs typically build a shrine and appoint a priestly class to pay homage to this \"deity\" and perform whatever sacrifices and rites are needed to minimize conflict.",
								"For example, zoogs living in a forest at the base of a powerful red dragon's mountain might set up a shrine to the dragon and kidnap sacrifices from surrounding hamlets that they might offer them up to the dragon to prevent the creature from attacking their forest. While humans, naturally enough, see this activity as evil, the zoogs view it as highly practical. They don't have the ability to slay the dragon, so they do what they can to avoid trouble, at minimal cost to their community.",
								"Because of this pattern of appeasement, zoogs have gathered a reputation for worshiping evil and unholy beings. This reputation is deserved to an extent: benign forces don't threaten the zoogs, so they don't feel a need to appease them in this way.

Thus, rather than chop down a tree for lumber, they might hollow out its limbs and add peepholes, grow magical fruits from it, or direct its growth so its roots emerge aboveground and tangle with other nearby trees to form a nigh impenetrable barrier.

Humanoids grow rightly suspicious of zoog forests and wary of traps, so zoogs usually lay multi-layer traps to maximize efficacy and lethality. When folk eventually learn to anticipate their technique, zoogs are always ready to escalate their traps to double or triple bluff hapless intruders. They think several steps ahead of their potential victims, leading them sometimes to overthink their traps, as they expect trespassers' minds to be as devious and byzantine as their own. For instance, when outsiders encounter a zoog trap in a forest, it might not be real. But it could be real, after all, because the zoogs know they'll think it's not real, so they make it real.

Even if they no longer want anything to do with the toxic culture of their origin, all but the most violently rebellious or distant of good-aligned Tcho-Tcho can expect regular communication from their clans. Clans view even wayward members as part of the family, and ex-pect them to do whatever is within their power to further the family's schemes and protect family interests. Even if a renegade member declares the family's goals or methods immoral, the family typically views the outburst as a petty affectation. Eventually, the member's refusal to do reprehensible deeds results in a cessation of trust: instead, the resentful family merely demands the passing along of intelligence or the destruction of evil mutual enemies.

Each dread condition has a save DC used for saving throws against its effects, generally matching the save DC of the effect that inflicted the dread condition. Creatures protected from or immune to the {@condition frightened} condition are similarly protected from or immune to dread.",

Some dread effects only apply when the source is within line of sight, but some linger even after a victim escapes the source of its dread. If there is not a clear source or the source doesn’t have a clear physical form, the dread effect applies as if it were constantly visible in all directions. Even after the immediate effect ends, a character afflicted with dread retains their current level of dread, so the next source of dread will cause the next higher effect.",

The longer of the new dread’s duration and the preexisting dread’s remaining duration applies to the new dread total. The dread condition’s save DC becomes the higher of the preexisting dread’s save DC and the new dread source’s DC.",
				"The effects of dread are additive: a creature suffers from the effect of its current level of dread as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature with two levels of dread is already spooked when they encounter a new source of dread, meaning it has disadvantage on ability checks while within line of sight of its source of dread and it can’t move closer to the source of its dread. If it fails its save against gaining 1 level of dread, it immediately increases to level 3 and is afraid.",
				"An effect that removes the {@condition frightened} condition removes three levels of dread unless it specifies otherwise, and other spells or effects that soothe emotions or reassure their beneficiaries might reduce dread as well (at the GM’s discretion). When a level of dread is removed, the creature no longer suffers from all the dread effects of the removed levels, and all dread effects end if a creature’s dread level is reduced below 1.",

If an effect doesn’t list a duration, a creature’s dread reduces by 1 level when the creature finishes a long rest.

One critical aspect to madness is to never confuse it with stupidity: an insane character may interpret their surroundings or events incorrectly, but within their (skewed) worldview, their actions are often logical. Neither should you confuse insanity with comic relief: an insane character can be entertaining but should not be a constant subject of ridicule or the butt of every joke. As with any character, your character should enrich the game rather than detract from it.",

For example, a person who sees things or hears voices that no one else can see or hear may seem insane, but the person’s condition could be caused by a permanent alteration to their brain that allows them to see or hear real entities in a parallel dimension to our own! Most importantly, there is no way for anyone to confirm whether the voices and hallucinations are real, short of acquiring the insanity themselves.",

Most of the Dreamlands’ features are larger-than-life exaggerations of waking-world geography that resemble their material counterparts in only the most general fashion (if they are recognizable at all).

A beggar in the real world may be a princess of the Dreamlands or vice versa. Inklings of Dreamlands events sometimes seep through: for example, upon awakening from dreams in which you were in love with someone who is a complete stranger in the material world, you might recall feelings not your own. In the way of dreams, when most people awaken from slumber, they forget everything about their lives in the Dreamlands.",
								"In parallel, when you awaken in the Dreamlands, your dream form knows nothing about your waking life unless you have a special means of remembering: you only remember the Dreamlands and events there. Unlike your physical body, your dream form doesn’t exist while you are awake in the material world: the dream form (includ-ing its worn and carried gear) vanishes entirely upon awakening physically. For ordinary dreamers, this often coincides with falling asleep in the Dreamlands, although being rudely woken in the material universe can cause the dream form to vanish just as suddenly.",
								"Your dream form reappears in the same state and with the same gear when your material body dreams again. A dream form must rest separately to heal and to restore limited-use features and traits such as spells. However, time spent vanished counts as time spent resting for this purpose, and time is distorted in the Dreamlands such that time for your dream form might pass faster or slower than it does for your material body. This stretching of time means that such rest rarely monopolizes time spent in the Dreamlands.",
								"A curious aspect of awakening in the Dreamlands is that you almost always emerge in the same spot there. This spot varies from person to person but is almost always in a part of the Dreamlands where you are relatively safe and can survive, such as a human-controlled town rather than a zoog forest. A dream form can establish a new home over the course of a long period by forming stronger relationships with a new safe place. People who dramatically shift their physical location (such as by traveling to another planet) sometimes dream themselves into the Dreamlands in the counterpart of their new location, but still in a place as safe and as similar to their true Dreamlands home as possible."

Spoken Aklo contains an empathic component best conveyed through telepathy, which resonates within the written form as well.",
				"The tenses of Aklo are not simply past, present, and future, but rather change like the fluid shifting of other realities and dimensions unreachable by mortals. Aklo is the language best suited to entities that perceive the passage of time differently from mortals: as a collection of simultaneous or nearly coterminous events rather than as a stream. Creatures that have undergone profound changes in their forms and minds (such as liches or other ancient, sentient undead) can also make good use of Aklo.",
				"Not all speakers comprehend Aklo at the same level. Some have access only to the fundamental principles of the tongue: those parts most similar to mortal speech. Others plunge so deep into the ideas of Aklo that they find it almost impossible to impart information to mortals. ",
				"Prolonged exposure to Aklo can permanently change a mortal’s understanding of time or reality, typically to his detriment in functioning in the mortal realm. Attempts to understand more than a primitive smattering of Aklo (a sort of pidgin) can result in madness, mania, or even death. Generally, this is represented in the {@variantrule dread|SPCM} and {@variantrule insanity|SPCM} rules as a moderate or major disturbing discovery.",
				"The effects of Aklo echo through its written form as well, so mortals must beware tomes written in this tongue. Beings incapable of verbal speech (such as gugs) may still be able to understand Aklo but cannot speak or otherwise transmit it, though they may be able to write its glyphs.",
				"Knowledge and wisdom are difficult to transmit fully by translating them from Aklo to a mortal language, and sometimes outright impossible. As no other language functions in the same way, some information is always lost or warped. While a few Aklo concepts can be delivered through other alphabets, typically the unique Aklo glyph system is necessary for full communication.",

During the first such dream after you cast this spell, Cthulhu can choose to provide a cryptic vision in response to up to three questions you ask.

If you don’t worship Cthulhu, however, a {@creature larval starspawn|SPCM} (or other worshiper of Cthulhu of the GM’s choice) becomes able to attack you with enchantment spells and ranged abilities that deal psychic damage or give the {@condition frightened} or {@condition charmed} conditions regardless of distance for as long as you remain asleep in the circle. When you take damage or succeed on a saving throw against a spell or other magical effect while sleeping in the circle, you can attempt a Charisma saving throw against this spell; you awaken on a success and the spell ends."
